Montage is a toolkit for assembling Flexible Image Transport System
(FITS) images into custom mosaics, dealing with datacubes and visualizing
image and cube data.

Montage has been tested by the Montage team on Linux platforms
with mosaics built from the 2-Micron All Sky Survey (2MASS) Atlas
(full-resolution) images. It has been built, tested and the output
products validated by Montage customers on Unix platforms, including
Linux, Solaris, Mac OSX, and IBM AIX. It has been used to generate
mosaics from data released by the Spitzer Space Telescope, the
Hubble Space Telescope, the Infrared Astronomical Satellite (IRAS),
the Midcourse Space Experiment (MSX), the Sloan Digital Sky Survey
(SDSS), and ground-based telescopes such as the National Optical
Astronomy Observatories (NOAO) 4-m telescope and the William Herschel
4-m telescope.

Under a new grant, Montage is being extended to deal with astronomical
data cubes and packaged for use on cloud computing resources.  The
current fileset has been uploaded here in preparation for that work
and consists of the original release with some update and additions
that have been made over the years but not officially released.
